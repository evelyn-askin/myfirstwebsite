<p>My first dog ever was a golden retiver, they are by far by favorite dog.<br> they are very
playful and cuddly. <br> I highly recommed getting one if you want a dog who loves you as much as you love them.</p>

<p>I have loved wolves since I was a kid. they are my spirit nimal and I think they
are the most beatiful animal on the planet. <br> I wish wolves were more tame so you could keep them as pets
because I really want one. <br> I dont know what it is about them but I love them.</p>

<p> Russian blue cats are absolute majestic creatures. They are hypoalergenic so if you are allergic
to cats you can have one.<br>  Thy are dependent on one person, they pick that one person
to love. <br> They are very friendly but mostly to their one person</p>
