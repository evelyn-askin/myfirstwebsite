        <p>Driving is one of my favroite things to do espcally since we have almost nothing to
        do but drive in Monatana. <br> Ive been driving since I was 14 and I am getting a new car soon. driving takes
      away a lot stress for me.</p>

        <p> Sleeping is like a passion for me. I am always tired during the day so I take about 9 naps a day unless I take like two really long
          ones. <br> I have insomnia so I don't really sleep at night but I love to sleep when I can and take it seriously.</p>
